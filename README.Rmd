#`greenbook`: Tools For Analzing US Foreign Policy Spending Data

The goal of greenbook is to facilitate user access to spending data related to various aspects of US foreign policy. The name of the package is based on the annual State Department and Defense Department "greenbooks" that contain annual budgetary and spending data. Currently the package only includes data from the US State Department's Overseas Loans and Grants greenbook, but I'll be adding more DOD data as I get the chance.

## Installation


You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("meflynn/greenbook")
```
The package is still in development so you can plan on seeing some added features in the coming months. Eventually I'll push a version to CRAN, too, but for now you'll have to rely on the GitHub version

## Example

This is a basic example of using the first function, `greenbook_aid()` to extract custom data on US economic and military aid. 

```{r example, warning=FALSE}
library(greenbook)

aiddata <- greenbook_aid(type = "all", recipient = c(200, 645, 700), startyear = 1946, endyear = 2020, value = NULL, format = "long")

head(aiddata)
```

The function has several arguments to let users tailor the data to their needs. The `recipient` argument takes correlates of war (COW) numeric country codes or ISO3C character codes. You can supply single values or a vector of values. 

the `startyear` and `endyear` arguments are required and determine the time span of the data. Currently the data go back to 1946 and up through 2020.

the `value` argument serves as a filter for historical dollar values (current) or inflation adjusted values (constant). Users can specify either or these, or leave the value argument out to return both values. 

Finally, the `format` argument will return the data in long or wide format, with the only difference currently being whether or not the constant and current values are stacked or not. But there are other variables contained in the resulting data frame that users can use to further arrange the data according to their needs.
